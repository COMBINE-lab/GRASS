This example is current under construction. Documentation, etc., to
come (on no particular schedule). 

If all is compiled and setup, running "sh runppa.sh" in this directory
should construct a graph (via the API) and output the results of
running MAD on the graph. The output should match that given in the
file "reference_output". Easily check it this way:

$ sh runppa.sh > my_output
$ diff my_output reference_output

Or, just do this if you don't need to look at the output:

$ ./runppa.sh | diff - reference_output

If all went as it should, you should see no differences.
